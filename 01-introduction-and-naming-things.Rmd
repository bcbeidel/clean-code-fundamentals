  Poorly written code is **more costly** in the long-run

  - more time to understand
  - more time to debug
  - more time to fix
  - more time to migrate
  - more time to test
</div>

## Writing code is reading code

> “Indeed, the ratio of time spent reading versus writing is well over 10 to 1. We are constantly reading old code as part of the effort to write new code. ...[Therefore,] making it easy to read makes it easier to write.”

*_So... be kind to your future self, and make your code easier to read._*

## Reading as a skill

Reading is a universal, trainable skill.  Reading code is no exception.  

- Elementary Reading
    - _"Do I understand the syntax of this line of code?"_
- Inspectional Reading
    - _"If skim this file, do I understand what it is trying to do?"_
- Analytical Reading
    - _"What is this application trying to do?"_
- Syntopical Reading
    - _"What are these applications trying to do as a whole?"_
    
    
## Naming things is hard  {.flexbox .vcenter}

## How to make less bad names

Consider making your names:

> - Informative 
> - Meaningfully Distinct
> - Consistent
> - Searchable
> - Contextual

## Un-Informative Variables

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
d = 90 # elapsed time in days
```

<br>

What is good and bad about the context of this line?

> - **Good:** Comment provides context on the variable contents and usage
> - **Bad:**  Later uses of `d` won't have that same context attached

## Informative Variables

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
elapsed_days = 90
```

<br>

What is so good about this version?

> - context is baked into `elapsed_days`
>   - a numeric value
>   - some represenation of time that has passed
> - context will travel with the use of the variable

## Un-Informative Functions

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
get_them = function(the_list){
  list1 = list()
  for (x in the_list) {
    if(x[0] == 4) {
      list1 = append(list1, x)
    }
  }
  return(list1)
}
```

What are the redeeming qualities of this function?

> - It runs, maybe.

## Informative Functions

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
extract_flagged_orders = function(orders){
  flagged_orders = list()
  for (order in orders){
    if (is_flagged_order(order)){
      flagged_orders = append(flagged_orders, order)
    }
  }
  return(flagged_orders)
}

is_flagged_order = function(order){
  return(order[0] == 4)
}
```

What questions are left unanswered by the code above?

## Meaningful distinctions {.flexbox .vcenter}

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
active_account         = get_active_account()
active_accounts        = harvest_active_accounts()
active_account_info    = collect_active_account_info()
active_account_data    = retrieve_active_account_data()
active_account_details = magically_generate_active_account_details()
```

![](./img/so-what-do-you-do-here.jpg)

## Inconsistent names

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
ad_data = fetch_adgroup_information(ids = ad_ids)
adgroup_performance = retrieve_ad_performance_data(x = ad_ids)
account_detail = collect_adgroup_details(account_numbers)
```

<br>
Questions a reader might have:

- What is the difference between `fetch`, `collect`, and `retrieve`?
- What does `ad_data` and `adgroup_performance` contain? Why is it different?

## Consistent names

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
adgroup_details     = collect_adgroup_details(ids = adgroup_ids)
adgroup_performance = collect_adgroup_performance(ids = adgroup_ids)
account_details     = collect_account_details(ids = account_ids)
```
<br>

> - What are the common verb(s)? What do they indicate?
>   - `collect`, we are probably pulling in data
> - What are the common nouns (i.e., objects)?
>   - `adgroup`, `account`, `id`, `details`
> - What additional knowledge does the reader need?
>   - Probably need some context on paid search accounts and adgroups  

## Un-Searchable Names

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE} 
for (ii in 1:length(ic)){
  if (it[ii] > ith){
     ti = ti + ic[ii]
  }
}
```

Searchable names helps find code when you are

> - fixing errors
> - refactoring
> - enhancing functionality

## Searchable Names

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE} 
for (impression_index in 1:length(impression_totals)){
  current_value = impressions[impression_index]
  if (current_value > impression_threshold){
    total_impressions = total_impressions + current_value
  }
}
```

## Without context

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
library(zeallot)
print_count_message = function(candidate, count){
  
  if (count == 0) {
    c(number, verb, modifier) %<-% c("no", "are", "s")
  } else if (count == 1) {
    c(number, verb, modifier) %<-% c("1", "is", "")
  } else {
    c(number, verb, modifier) %<-% c(toString(count), "are", "s")
  }
  guess_message = sprintf("There %s %s %s%s", verb, number, candidate, modifier)
  print(guess_message)
}
```

## And now, with context

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
print_count_message

```

public class GuessStatisticsMessage {
 private String number;
 private String verb;
 private String pluralModifier;
 public String make(char candidate, int count) {
 createPluralDependentMessageParts(count);
 return String.format(
 "There %s %s %s%s",
 verb, number, candidate, pluralModifier );
 }
 private void createPluralDependentMessageParts(int count) {
 if (count == 0) {
 thereAreNoLetters();
 } else if (count == 1) {
 thereIsOneLetter();
 } else {
 thereAreManyLetters(count);
 }
 }
 private void thereAreManyLetters(int count) {
 number = Integer.toString(count);
 verb = "are";
 pluralModifier = "s";
 }
 private void thereIsOneLetter() {
 number = "1";
 verb = "is";
 pluralModifier = "";
 }
 private void thereAreNoLetters() {
 number = "no";
 verb = "are";
 pluralModifier = "s";
 }
}
