  Poorly written code is **more costly** in the long-run

  - more time to understand
  - more time to debug
  - more time to fix
  - more time to migrate
  - more time to test

## Writing code is reading code

> “Indeed, the ratio of time spent reading versus writing is well over 10 to 1. We are constantly reading old code as part of the effort to write new code. ...[Therefore,] making it easy to read makes it easier to write.”

## Reading as a skill

Reading is a universal, trainable skill.  Reading code is no exception.  

- Elementary Reading
    - _"Do I understand the syntax of this line of code?"_
- Inspectional Reading
    - _"If skim this file, do I understand what it is trying to do?"_
- Analytical Reading
    - _"What is this application trying to do?"_
- Syntopical Reading
    - _"What are these applications trying to do as a whole?"_
