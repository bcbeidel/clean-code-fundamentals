  Poorly written code is **more costly** in the long-run

  - more time to understand
  - more time to debug
  - more time to fix
  - more time to migrate
  - more time to test

## Writing code is reading code

> “Indeed, the ratio of time spent reading versus writing is well over 10 to 1. We are constantly reading old code as part of the effort to write new code. ...[Therefore,] making it easy to read makes it easier to write.”

*_So... be kind to your future self, and make your code easier to read._*

## Reading as a skill

Reading is a universal, trainable skill.  Reading code is no exception.  

- Elementary Reading
    - _"Do I understand the syntax of this line of code?"_
- Inspectional Reading
    - _"If skim this file, do I understand what it is trying to do?"_
- Analytical Reading
    - _"What is this application trying to do?"_
- Syntopical Reading
    - _"What are these applications trying to do as a whole?"_

## How to make less bad names

A few techniques...

> - Reveal your intent
> - Make meaningful distinctions
> - Use searchable names
> - One word, one concept
> - Use domain concepts

## Reveal your intent

Which would you choose?
```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
d = 90 # elapsed time in days

elapsed_days = 90
```

<br>
Good names aren't just for variables anymore.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
getThem = function(d){
  ...
}

extractFlaggedOrders = function(orders){
  ...
}
```

## Make meaningful distinctions {.flexbox .vcenter}

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
getActiveAcount()
getActiveAccounts()
getActiveAccountInfo()
getActiveAccountData()
getActiveAccountDetails()
```

![](./img/so-what-do-you-do-here.jpg)

## Use searchable names

What does this do?

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE} 
for (ii in 1:length(ic)){
  if (it[ii] > ith){
     ti = ti + ic[ii]
  }
}
```

## Now with searchable context...

How about now?

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE} 
for (impression_index in 1:length(impression_totals)){
  current_value = impressions[impression_index]
  if (current_value > impression_threshold){
    total_impressions = total_impressions + current_value
  }
}
```

## One word, once concept

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
ad_data = fetch_adgroup_information(ids = ad_ids)
adgroup_performance = retrieve_ad_performance_data(x = ad_ids)
account_detail = collect_adgroup_details(account_numbers)
```
<br>
```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
adgroup_details     = collect_adgroup_details(ids = adgroup_ids)
adgroup_performance = collect_adgroup_performance(ids = adgroup_ids)
account_details     = collect_account_details(ids = account_ids)
```

## Use domain concepts
