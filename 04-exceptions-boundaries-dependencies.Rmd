## Nomenclature: Exceptions v. Errors

**Error:**

  - indicates serious problems that a reasonable application should not try to catch.
  - i.e., you can't fix it, give up now (think syntax error)

**Exception:**

  - indicates a condition that we can catch, and possibly recover from
  - Your program runs, but runs into a condition it doesn't know how to handle, so you throw an exception

python, has `InsertNameHereError`, R has `stop()` and `warning()`.  The names may change, but the idea is still the same. Errors can't be handled, exceptions can be handled.

## Clean Exception Handling

- Start with the `Try-Catch-Finally`
- Provide context
- DON'T RETURN NULL
- DON'T PASS NULL

## Begin with the end in mind

```{python, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE, python.reticulate = FALSE}
# main.py
try:
    bids = calculate_bid(adgroup_id=an_id)
except ValueError as err:
    print("An invalid value provided, defaulting to 0 bid. ", err)
    bids = 0
except:
    print("Unexpected error:", sys.exc_info()[0])
    raise
```

- Which exception block handles the broadest category of things?
- Which block would you consider exception v. error handling?
- What does `raise` do?

## Now for the next turtle down...

```{python, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE, python.reticulate = FALSE}
# bid_calculator.py
def calculate_bid(adgroup_id):

    if type(adgroup_id) != int:
        raise ValueError("adgroup_id must be an integer")

    if adgroup_id < 0:
        raise ValueError("adgroup_id must be greater than 0")

    raise NotImplementedError("Get to work.")
```

---

- What conditions are required to hit: 
  - `ValueError("adgroup_id must be an integer")`
  - `ValueError("adgroup_id must be greater than 0")`
  - `NotImplementedError("This method is not implemented. Get to work.")`
- What is the caller expected to do for each option?

## What causes `null` exceptions?

- “uninitialized” reference type variables — variables which are initialized with nulls and are assigned their real value afterward. A bug can cause them never to be reassigned.
- uninitialized reference-type class members.
- explicit assignment to null or returning null from a function

## Why are they bad?

- It makes tracing (and debugging) the real problem harder
- It hides the original error

If you don't believe me, believe Sir Charles Antony Richard Hoare, developer of the `QuickSort` algorithm. [Null References: The Billion Dollar Mistake](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Null-References-The-Billion-Dollar-Mistake-Tony-Hoare)

## An contrived example...

```{python, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE, python.reticulate = FALSE}
def get_reciprocal(x):
    if x == 0:
        return None
    return 1 / x

def double_a_number(x):
    return 2 * x

def pass_a_number(x):
    return x

def manipulate_number(x):
    reciprocal = get_reciprocal(x)
    another_step = pass_a_number(reciprocal)
    double_reciprocal = double_a_number(another_step)

    return double_reciprocal
```

- What would we expect the stack-trace to look like?
- Where would be a better location for an explicit check and error?
- Why is it bad?

## Boundaries {.flexbox .vcenter}

```{r, out.width = "600px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./img/boundaries.jpeg")
```

## Boundaries, why do we care?

## How can we protect ourselves?

Boundaries are effective construct that can help protect from headaches.  Some migraine reducing techniques include:

- Wrapping, centralizing usage of 3rd party code 
- Interfaces and Dependency Injection Patterns
- Use of learning tests

## Wrapping 3rd Party Code: Part 1

```{python, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE, python.reticulate = FALSE}
# main.py
def is_most_recent_version(file):
    existing_file_meta_data = dbx.get_meta_data(file.name)
    if existing_file_meta_data is None:
        return True
    if existing_file_meta_data.date > file.date: 
        return False
    return True

if __name__ == "__main__":
    dbx = dropbox.Dropbox(config.access_token)
    file_list = get_files_for_upload()
    for file in file_list:
        if (is_most_recent_version(file)):
            dbx.file_upload(file)
```

- What external service is our code dependent on?
- How could we insulate ourselves from these changes?

## Wrapping 3rd Party Code: Part 2

```{python, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE, python.reticulate = FALSE}
# DocumentWarehouse.py
class DocumentWarehouse:
    def __init__(self, access_token):
        self.dbx = dropbox.Dropbox(access_token)

    def should_be_updated(self, file):
        meta  = self.dbx.get_meta_data(file.name)
        if meta is None: # No file in DBX
            return False
        if meta.date > file.date # existing file is more recent
            return False
        return True

    def upload_file(self, file):
        self.dbx.upload_file(file)
```

## Wrapping 3rd Party Code: Part 3

```{python, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE, python.reticulate = FALSE}
# main.py (refactored)
import DocumentWarehouse

if __name__ == "__main__":
    dw = DocumentWarehouse(config.access_token)
    file_list - get_files_for_upload()
    for file in file_list:
        if dw.file_should_be_updated(file):
            dw.upload_file(file)
```

- What challenges would switching to AWS provide?
- How would that change if you were asked to maintain access to both AWS and dropbox?

## Wrapping 3rd Party Code: Part 4

```{python, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE, python.reticulate = FALSE}
from abc import abstractmethod

class DocumentWarehouse:
    @abstractmethod
    def should_be_updated(self, file=str):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def upload_file(self, file=str):
        pass
```

---

```{python, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE, python.reticulate = FALSE}
from DocumentWarehouse import DocumentWarehouse
from dropbox import dropbox

class DropboxWarehouse(DocumentWarehouse):

    def __init__(self, access_key):
        self.dbx = dropbox.Dropbox(access_key)

    def should_be_updated(self, file=str):
        meta  = self.dbx.get_meta_data(file.name)
        if meta is None: # No file in DBX
            return False
        if meta.date > file.date: # existing file is more recent
            return False
        return True

    def upload_file(self, file=str):
        self.dbx.upload_file(file)
```

---

```{python, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE, python.reticulate = FALSE}
from DocumentWarehouse import DocumentWarehouse
from aws import s3

class S3Warehouse(DocumentWarehouse):

    def __init__(self, access_key):
        self.s3 = s3(access_key)

    def should_be_updated(self, file=str):
        meta  = self.s3.get_details(file.name)
        if meta.file_exists == False:
            return True
        if meta.date > file.date: # existing file is more recent
            return False
        return True

    def upload_file(self, file=str):
        self.s3.save_file(file)
```

## But Why?

Now, we can swap our storage provider with a single line of code...

```{python, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE, python.reticulate = FALSE}
if __name__ == "__main__":
    dw = DropboxWarehouse(config.access_token)
    file_list - get_files_for_upload()
    for file in file_list:
        if dw.file_should_be_updated(file):
            dw.upload_file(file)
##########################
if __name__ == "__main__":
    dw = S3Warehouse(config.access_token)
    file_list - get_files_for_upload()
    for file in file_list:
        if dw.file_should_be_updated(file):
            dw.upload_file(file)
```

## Think contracts

`polymorphism` - is the provision of a single interface to entities of different types or the use of a single symbol to represent multiple different types

`design-by-contract` - prescribes that software designers should define formal, precise and verifiable interface specifications for software components, which extend the ordinary definition of abstract data types

<hr>

Each language may (or may not) implement some form of this. Some terms you might hear:

- Abstract Classes (Python, Java, C#)
- Interfaces (Java, C#, Python, Go)
- Traits (Scala)
- S3 + S4 Objects, and RefClases (R)
