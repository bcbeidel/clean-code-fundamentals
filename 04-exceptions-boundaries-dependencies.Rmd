## Don't jump around...

## Nomenclature: Exceptions v. Errors

**Error:**

  - indicates serious problems that a reasonable application should not try to catch.
  - i.e., you can't fix it, give up now (think syntax error)

**Exception:**

  - indicates a condition that we can catch, and possibly recover from
  - Your program runs, but runs into a condition it doesn't know how to handle, so you throw an exception

python, has `InsertNameHereError`, R has `stop()` and `warning()`.  The names may change, but the idea is still the same. Errors can't be handled, exceptions can be handled.

## Clean Exception Handling

- Start with the `Try-Catch-Finally`
- Provides context
- DON'T RETURN NULL
- DON'T PASS NULL

## Begin with the end in mind

```{python, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE, python.reticulate = FALSE}
try:
    bids = calculate_bid(adgroup_id=an_id)
except ValueError as err:
    print("An invalid value provided, defaulting to 0 bid. ", err)
    bids = 0
except:
    print("Unexpected error:", sys.exc_info()[0])
    raise
```

- Which exception block handles the most broad category of things?
- Which block would you consider exception v. error handling?
- What does `raise` do?

## Now for the next turtle down...

```{python, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE, python.reticulate = FALSE}
# bid_calculator.py
def calculate_bid(adgroup_id):

    if type(adgroup_id) != int:
        raise ValueError("adgroup_id must be an integer")

    if adgroup_id < 0:
        raise ValueError("adgroup_id must be greater than 0")

    raise NotImplementedError("This function is not implemented. Get to work.")
```

- What conditions are required to hit: 
  - `ValueError("adgroup_id must be an integer")`
  - `ValueError("adgroup_id must be greater than 0")`
  - `NotImplementedError("This method is not implemented. Get to work.")`
- What is the caller expected to do for each option?

## What causes `null` exceptions?

- “uninitialized” reference type variables — variables which are initialized with nulls and are assigned their real value afterward. A bug can cause them never to be reassigned.
- uninitialized reference-type class members.
- explicit assignment to null or returning null from a function

## Why are they bad?

- It makes tracing (and debugging) the real problem harder
- It hides the original error

If you don't believe me, believe Sir Charles Antony Richard Hoare, developer of the `QuickSort` algorithm. [Null References: The Billion Dollar Mistake](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Null-References-The-Billion-Dollar-Mistake-Tony-Hoare)

## An contrived example...

```{python, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE, python.reticulate = FALSE}
def get_reciprocal(x):
    if x == 0:
        return None
    return 1 / x

def double_a_number(x):
    return 2 * x

def pass_a_number(x):
    return x

def manipulate_number(x):
    reciprocal = get_reciprocal(x)
    another_step = pass_a_number(reciprocal)
    double_reciprocal = double_a_number(another_step)

    return double_reciprocal
```

- What would we expect the stack-trace to look like?
- Where would be a better location for an explicit check and error?
- Why is it bad?

## Boundaries {.flexbox .vcenter}

![](./img/boundaries.jpeg)

## Boundaries, why do we care?

## How can we protect ourselves?

Boundaries are effective construct that can help protect from headaches.  Some migrane reducing techniques include:

- Wrapping, centralizing usage of 3rd party code
- Use of learning tests
- Interfaces and Dependency Injection Patterns
- Decouple 


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
