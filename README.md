# clean-code-fundamentals

A short workshop series on coding heuristics, intended to help people of all coding skill levels write cleaner, more maintainable code.  The content is primarily based on the book _Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship_ by Robert C. Martin.

## What this is not...

This is not a computer science course.  This will not teach you the inner workings of the matrix, machine learning, or any other cutting edge technologies.  This will not make your code impervious to bugs, server outages, hackers, or PEBCAK errors.  Luckily, if you want to learn those things there are many very smart people on the internet that can help teach you those skills, but I am not one of them.

## What this intended to be...

This is intended to share a series of coding heuristics, that have been impressed upon me by previous mentors, managers and coworkers, all who make frequent reference to writing software as a craft, as skills to be honed over time, shared with others, and to be deliberately revisited as new tools and techniques are introduced.  I have found the _Clean Code_ book one of many great resources for programmers to build a shared lexicon to identify, discuss and target technical debt and questionable programming descions (a.k.a. code smells).


## Sessions
