## Functions: Friend or Foe?

**Question: Functions can be used to do which of the following:**

<br>

A) Create descriptive landmarks in the flow of logic
B) Provide concise summary of inputs for a task
C) Encapsulate logic into small, testable blocks
D) Create reusable blocks of applicaiton logic

<br> 

> - Answer, It can do all of these things, but only if you try...

## Qualities of a Good Function

What are some things that make a good function?

<br>

> Has a descriptive name
> Is Small
> Does One Thing
> Uses Fewer Arguments
> Provides a single layer of abstraction
> Is Side Effect Free

## Use descriptive names 

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
get_em = function(orders){
  flagged_orders = list()
  for (order in orders){
    if (is_flagged_order(order)){
      flagged_orders = append(flagged_orders, order)
    }
  }
  return(flagged_orders)
}
```

> - **Question: What are some suggested names for this function?**

---

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
extract_flagged_orders = function(orders){
  flagged_orders = list()
  for (order in orders){
    if (is_flagged_order(order)){
      flagged_orders = append(flagged_orders, order)
    }
  }
  return(flagged_orders)
}
```

## Keep it small

---

Rule of Thumb: 5 lines or less

## Limit your inputs

## Abstract a single layer

## Don't create side-effects

## The Exercise

## Another exercise.

**Description:** Find a partner and exchange a block of code you have written. 50-100 lines. Try and refactor the code based on our discussion while maintaining functionality.  For the first 10 minutes try not to ask any questions, and allow the code to "speak" for itself.

**Time:** 30 Minutes Total

- 10 Minutes - Refactor partner code, no questions
- 10 Minutes - Refactor partner code, with questions
- 10 Minutes - Review your results with your partner
